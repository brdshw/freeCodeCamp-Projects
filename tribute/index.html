          Lili was born male and originally named
          <strong>Einar Mogens Wegener</strong>. As a teenager, she attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It was here that she fell in love with her future wife, Gerda Gottlieb. Einar was born male and orginally named Einar Mogens
          Wegener Studied art at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen as a teenager. While Einar was a landscape painter, Gerda specialized in portraits and fashion. After modeling numerous times as a woman for Gerda, Lily became to realize that
          the internal struggles she had throughout her lifetime were rooted in the fact that she indentified as a female, instead of her assigned gender of male. Einar began to explore living as a woman with the assistance of her wife.

        <p>After the couple moved to Paris in 1912, Einar transitioned to publicly living as a woman and assumed the name of Lili. In the 1920's, Lili learned that she could possibly transform her body from that of a male to a female through a radical
          surgery technique that
          <strong>Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld</strong>
          was pioneering at the German Institude of Sexual Science in Berlin. In 1930, she underwent the first of four sexual reassingment surgeries. Becoming one of the first to attempt these procedures. After the fourth procedure, preformed by
          <strong>Dr. Kurt Warnekros</strong>
          at the Dresden Municpal Women's Clinic. Lili was permitted to legally change her name and her gender, allowing her to recieve a passport under the name Lili Elbe. This was an extraordianary accomplishment for the time. Sadly, Lili died just before
          her 49th birthday due to post-operative complications from her surgeries. Her story has inspired two books. The first which was compiled from her journal entries was
          <em>Man into Woman</em>, which was orignally published in 1933. The second was a dramatization of her life named
          <em>The Danish Girl</em>, which was also adapted into a film of the same name.</p>
